Duration: [Month, Year] - [Month, Year]
Tools: Google Colab, Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow

Project Description:
Developed a machine learning-based movie recommendation system aimed at enhancing user experience by suggesting movies tailored to individual preferences.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned movie datasets, including user ratings, movie details, and genres.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to understand user behavior and movie rating patterns, utilizing visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented collaborative filtering techniques, including user-based and item-based filtering, to predict user ratings for movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Built a content-based recommendation model leveraging movie metadata to suggest similar movies based on genre, director, and keywords.
Hybrid Model: Developed a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as RMSE and precision-recall, and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Deployment: Deployed the recommendation system on Google Colab, ensuring it was user-friendly and accessible.
Achievements:

Achieved significant improvements in recommendation accuracy by integrating hybrid model techniques.
Enhanced user engagement by providing personalized movie recommendations.
Gained hands-on experience in machine learning model development, evaluation, and deployment.
